# Prog1-SudokuGame
Fully functional Sudoku game created for programming fundamentals class project. A randomly generated board is populated with integer values in conformity with the rules of Sudoku (sudoku_generator.py). Additionally, classes (cell.py and board.py) are used to assign board and cell objects with parameters relevant to play. Specifically, cell objects store their value and selection status. Additionally, board objects store their capacity, fullness, and cells. Finally, the external library PyGame is utilized in the main file (sudoku.py) to output user graphics, respond using event-driven programming, and update board and cell parameters to progress the game.
